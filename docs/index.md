# Background - Trust on the Internet

Putting Internet users - and organizations - in control of their own online Identity has been a growing challenge since the start of the internet. With the creation of massive centralized stores of private data (e.g. Equifax, Google, Facebook, etc.), the ability to for holders to use that data in ways that are not always in the best interest of the data owner (you!), and the rise of cyberhacking exposing that data, a change is needed in how our data is handled. [Self-Sovereign Identity](https://bitsonblocks.net/2017/05/17/a-gentle-introduction-to-self-sovereign-identity/) is a promising approach to decentralize the control and location of our data, giving control of our data back to us. Taken further, SSI enables a higher level of trust on the Internet by providing mechanisms that enable verifiable identification of parties to a transaction, reducing the need for high-cost mechanisms to establish trust.

This project is particularly interested in that last attribute of SSI in the context of Verified Organizations. Notably, increasing trust for online transactions to foster economic activity for BC Companies locally and across the globe.

## Creating a Network Effect

[TheFaceBook](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/) at Harvard used a very clever network effect to bootstrap the new world of Social Networks. Mark Zuckerberg pre-loaded TheFacebook with accounts that provided a core of users with one common attribute (they went to Harvard) as an effective starting point for building an ever growing network. His contrived "network-effect" magnified subsequent actions of users, resulting in the ever-faster growth of TheFaceBook's, and ultimately, Facebook's network. Without seeding the network, the growth may never have come.

We're trying to use **"TheOrgBook"** to generate that same network effect for building Self-Sovereign Identities and the use of [Verified Claims](https://w3c.github.io/webpayments-ig/VCTF/charter/faq.html) for Verified Organizations.

## The problem: Supply and Demand

The challenge in creating an SSI network is:

* **Supply:** Services don't support Verified Claims because there are no Organizations with their on SSI Digital Wallets.
* **Demand:** Organizations don't have a need for their own SSI Digital Wallets because there are no Services that support Verified Claims.

We can't directly influence the demand, but as a major supplier of Services (registrations, licenses, permits, etc.) to organizations, we can enhance our local Services to drive supply. TheOrgBook gives Services a place to both issue Verified Claims and receive proofs about Verified Claims without needing Organizations to have their own wallets.

Here's a simple picture of the system:

![](assets/images/TheOrgBook-HighLevel.png)

* Desks are Services that Organizations use to register their business and from which they receive permits and licenses
* TheOrgBook is a repository of the public claims generated by those Services
  * Claims are equivalent to the "Permit to Operate" documents posted on the wall
  * The repo is web-searchable, listing organizations, claims and claim details
* The Identity Register Network is underlies the system to drive trust
  * a decentralized Self-Sovereign Identity network based on distributed ledger technology

As an Organization goes through an online process to acquire their Registrations/Licenses/Permits, the Services gets proofs (and their associated data) from Verified Claims already stored in the database.

- This saves the users from having to re-type the information for each Service (and eliminates typos in the data)
- Each Service can trust the information because it comes from a trusted source - and is cryptographically signed

The Code
-----------

We're currently building two components to support TheOrgBook:

### TheOrgBook ([this repo](https://github.com/bcgov/TheOrgBook))

Code to make it easy to spin up instances of TheOrgBook in different jurisdictions or in different business domains. The capabilities of each instance of TheOrgBook includes:

* A repository of Verified Organizations built around a foundational claim about an Organization
  * in our case, the foundational claim is from [BC Registries](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/citizens-services/bc-registries-online-services)
* Web interface for searching/displaying Verified Organizations by name, location and types of claims held.
* An interface to underlying Identity Register Networks - initially a [Hyperledger Indy](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/README.md) network, with capabilities to:
  * Receive issued Verified Claims from known Services about subject Verified Organizations
  * Provide Proofs to Services about subject Verified Organizations

### Verified Organization Network (VON) Connector (repo to be created)

The VON-Connector is code to minimize the effort for a Service to become SSI-enabled and able to use an instance of TheOrgBook. The capabilities of a VON-Connector include:

* An interface to underlying Identity Register Networks
* A query interface to known instances of the TheOrgBook
* Request proofs about a Verified Organization's claim from an instance of TheOrgBook
* Issue verified claims about an Organization to an instance of TheOrgBook
* Request proofs from an SSI-enabled Organization
* Issue verified claims to an SSI-enabled Organization
* Provide updates (including revocations) of verified claims to TheOrgBook and/or SSI-enabled Organizations
